# WebsocketMessageObject
WebsocketMessageObject is an API that enables you to package any type of data into a single (binary format) massage so that you can easily send it over websocket protocol. You simply create a wmo object and keep adding any data into it by calling the appropriate functions provided in the API, then finally call the 'Encode' function which converts everything into a stream of binary data that you can send to your back-end server using the 'websocket.send(theBinaryData)' function. You can add images, videos, documents, json data as well as plain text data.
